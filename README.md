# MoroccoDroughtML

This repo contains a python notebook where we use the segmentation model Unet multioutput S2-to-L8 that can be found in https://huggingface.co/isp-uv-es/ml4floods to detect water prensence in satellite pictures. More specifically, we use this model on pictures of the second largest water dam in Morocco taken by Sentinel 2 satellites to highlight the effect of the drought crisis in the country.
